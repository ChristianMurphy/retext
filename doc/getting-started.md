# Getting Started

**retext** transforms natural language.
It’s an ecosystem of [plugins][].
If you get stuck, [issues][] and [spectrum][] are good places to get help.

retext is built on [unified][], make sure to read it and its [website][] too.

## Introduction

Out of the box, **retext** doesn’t do anything.
But much can be done [through plugins][plugins].

## Programmatic usage

The programmatic interface of **retext** is provided by [**unified**][unified].
In fact, [`retext`][api] is two plugins:
[`retext-latin`][latin] and [`retext-stringify`][stringify].

Install [`retext`][api] with [npm][]:

```bash
npm install retext retext-equality retext-simplify
```

`index.js` contains:

```js
var retext = require('retext')
var simplify = require('retext-simplify')
var equality = require('retext-equality')
var report = require('vfile-reporter')

retext()
  .use(simplify)
  .use(equality)
  .process('Hey guys, utilize a shorter word.', function(err, file) {
    console.log(String(file))
    console.error(report(err || file))
  })
```

`node index.js` yields:

```txt
Hey guys, utilize a shorter word.
    1:5-1:9  warning  `guys` may be insensitive, use `people`, `persons`, `folks` instead  gals-men  retext-equality
  1:11-1:18  warning  Replace `utilize` with `use`                                         utilize   retext-simplify
